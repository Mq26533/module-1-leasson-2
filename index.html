    <b>Basketball</b>  is a <i> team sport</i> in which two teams
    , most commonly of five players each, 
    opposing one another on a rectangular 
    court, compete with the primary objective
     of shooting a basketball (approximately 
     9.4 inches (24 cm) in diameter) through 
     the defender's hoop (a basket 18 inches 
     (46 cm) in diameter mounted 10 feet (3.048
      m) high to a backboard at each end of the
       court), while preventing the opposing
        team from shooting through their own 
        hoop. A field goal is worth two points,
         unless made from behind the 
         three-point line, when it is 
         worth three.
         <br><br> 
         After a foul, 
         timed play stops and the player 
         fouled or designated to shoot a 
         technical foul is given one, two 
         or three one-point free throws. 
         The team with the most points 
         at the end of the game wins, but if regulation play expires with the score tied, an additional period of play (overtime) is mandated.
